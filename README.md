# SwerveVacuum

## What this thing is
The Swerve Vacuum is designed to be built on top of the current vacuum cleaner.
It will have two swerve drives; one will be on the main body of the vacuum to move it, and the other one will be on the intake of the pipe to move it.
The finished project will be driven with both joysticks on a controller.
The left joystick will control the main vacuum cleaner, and the right joystick will control the hose.
We will also have a button to turn the vacuum on and off.
